\section{Derivations}
Because this is a 2D ideal gas moving in a natural environment, we can assume that $v_x = v_y$ because the gas has no external force applied to it; it is merely moving naturally.
Because the gas is ideal, $$\Delta p = p_{i,x} - p_{f,x} = p_x - (-p_x) = 2p_x$$ when a particle of the gas hits a wall. This is because the speed remains the same and because the direction of the perpendicular component changes upon a collision with a wall.
Therefore, the time $\Delta t$ between each particle's collisions with a wall is $\frac{2L}{|v_x|}$ assuming that the area of the 2D space is $L^2$.
This change in momentum upon a collision is a force. The force of a singular particle colliding with a wall is therefore given by $$F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{2mv_xv_x}{2L} = \frac{mv_x^2}{L}$$ Therefore, by summing all of momentum changes, the total force on the walls of the container can be calculated is $$F = \frac{Nmv_x^2}{4L}$$ This force gives the total \emph{pressure} of the container.
