give particles a velocity over a standard distribution


degrees of freedom = number of possible rotations + number of possible translations in
space


kinetic theory of gases:
each degree of freedom of an ideal gas gets 1/2kT of energy where k = Boltzmann's
constant and T = temperature.

symmetry is the most important thing ever. Without it, nothing would work.
ML is computationally hard because you're trying to find symmetries in high dimensional
space.

Every degree of freedom gets the same amount of energy. That just makes sense because of
symmetry

Space is homogeneous, space is isothropic.

kT is the destructor of the world. kT is this energy in space because we are here. 

Electrons emit photons when bounding around.

contact is an electron moving 

types of transfering heat: (they're never touching, just close enough)
conduction
radiation

atoms naturally want to go down


two parts of a real gas:
there are the real particles
there are the photons carrying information about the gas

kT is the energy of the environment. Just the external energy that is always there.

the kT everywhere, its kind of like noise

<X> = average of X
ideal gases have no potential energy. They only have kinetic energy
no potential energy  = no forces and no forces = no potential energy
<KE> = kT

IN THE FLAT WORLD:
We're in euclidian space: a dot b = a scalar
v dot v = v ^ 2

think of kinetic energy as always being a vector


linear function means you can take something out of the numerator



average x vel is going to be pretty much the same as the average y vel
IN NATURE

model helium at 100Kelvin. helium tells you the mass, 100 kelvin tells you T
(temperature).


how many particles have average energy of kT
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases

T = mv^2 / 3k


the closer two electrons get, they can see each others cores. Atoms don't like this
because the cores of the atoms don't want to merge together: that's not really possible.

the minimum energy (stable place) is where bonds happen (chemistry)

get editor to make an essay outline
when to start studying
I am taking August 27 and September 7
should I even take them
